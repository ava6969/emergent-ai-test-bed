  \ (r_i = (Close_16:00 - Open_09:30) / Open_09:30).\n- Provide a quantitative ranking\
  \ with percentage returns (rounded to \xB10.01% precision).\n- Include sector composition\
  \ details: number of stocks per sector, number of used constituents, and coverage\
  \ percentage.\n- Validate data completeness with at least 97% of 5-minute bars present\
  \ for each symbol (\u226576 of 78 bars); a sector is only included if \u226590%\
  \ of its constituents meet this criterion.\n- Deliver results within 120 seconds\
  \ of the request, confirming the timestamp of the request in UTC."
