name: Long-Short Equity Strategy Backtest
objective: "Backtest a long-short equity strategy using daily adjusted OHLCV data\
  \ from S&P 500 constituents point-in-time sourced from Refinitiv/CRSP for the period\
  \ of January 3, 2022, to December 29, 2023 (2 years). The strategy aims to achieve\
  \ a Sharpe ratio \u2265 1.0, with a maximum drawdown (MDD) \u2264 15%. The strategy\
  \ will use a sample signal based on technical indicators such as the 50-day moving\
  \ average crossover for entry and exit points, with a weekly rebalance frequency."
simulation_mode: true
success_criteria: "- Portfolio contains 20-30 positions total, with a maximum of 15\
  \ positions on either the long or short side at each rebalance.\n- Achieves an annualized\
  \ Sharpe ratio \u2265 1.0 (risk-free rate = 2%) based on daily returns, with Sharpe\
  \ calculated using sqrt(252) for annualization.\n- Maximum drawdown \u2264 15% measured\
  \ on the daily equity curve.\n- Win rate \u2265 55% measured per trade, where a\
  \ trade is defined as a complete buy-sell cycle for a position.\n- Backtest output\
  \ includes a detailed performance summary with a monthly returns table, risk metrics\
  \ (1-day historical VaR at 95% confidence calculated over a trailing 252-day window,\
  \ beta calculated against SPY using 252 daily returns), and position sizes.\n- Incorporates\
  \ transaction costs of 5 basis points per side, with a slippage model of 5 basis\
  \ points. Assumes a short borrow fee of 30 basis points annually for short positions.\n\
  - Backtesting completes in \u2264 5 minutes on an S&P 500 universe using Python\
  \ on a 4-core CPU."
