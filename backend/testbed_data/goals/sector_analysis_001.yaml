name: Sector Performance Comparison
objective: Analyze the performance of US equity sectors over the last 30 trading days
  ending at the most recent market close (4:00 PM ET) using daily OHLCV data from
  S&P 500 constituents sourced from Refinitiv. The analysis should identify the top
  3 sectors by average total return, calculated using a cap-weighted methodology that
  incorporates adjusted close prices and dividends.

success_criteria: "- Agent identifies 3 sectors with the highest cap-weighted average\
  \ total return over the last 30 trading days.\n- Provides quantitative ranking with\
  \ percentage returns (\xB10.01% precision).\n- Includes sector composition (number\
  \ of stocks per sector) based on GICS classification.\n- Validates data completeness\
  \ with at least 95% of expected data points (Nstocks \xD7 Ndays closing prices)\
  \ present per sector and \u226598% per individual stock.\n- Handles missing data\
  \ with forward-fill allowed only for up to 2 consecutive days of missing data (no\
  \ forward-fill across delistings or sector changes) and specifies rejection criteria\
  \ for incomplete data.\n- Delivers results in a structured format (JSON or CSV)\
  \ including fields: sector_code, sector_name, n_constituents, avg_return_pct, rank,\
  \ window_start, window_end, data_source, classification, and weighting, within 5\
