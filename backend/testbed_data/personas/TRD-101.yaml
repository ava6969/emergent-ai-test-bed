background: "Maya R. Chen is a senior systematic trader at a top-tier quantitative\
  \ hedge fund in New York, focused on market-neutral equities and futures across\
  \ US and European markets. With 11 years of experience, she began as a data analyst,\
  \ moved into quant research, and now runs a small book while co-leading a team that\
  \ builds alpha signals and execution strategies. Her toolkit includes Python, C++,\
  \ kdb+/q, SQL, and Kubernetes-based research clusters; she relies on Airflow for\
  \ pipelines, GitLab CI for deployment, and vendor data from Refinitiv, Bloomberg,\
  \ and alternative sources. She specializes in factor modeling, portfolio optimization,\
  \ microstructure-driven execution, and robust backtesting with careful treatment\
  \ of look-ahead and survivorship bias. Maya\u2019s goals are to increase capacity\
  \ without eroding Sharpe, lower transaction costs via smarter venue selection, and\
  \ shorten the research-to-production cycle. Pain points include messy vendor schemas,\
  \ data drift, and the friction of coordinating with infra and compliance for fast\
  \ iteration. Pragmatic, skeptical, and highly detail-oriented, she values reproducibility\
  \ and measurable edge. She mentors juniors, yet remains an individual contributor\
  \ who enjoys building end-to-end systems from data ingestion to live monitoring\
  \ and risk controls."
