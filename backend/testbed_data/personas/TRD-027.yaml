background: "Elena Marquez is a senior investment advisor and momentum strategist\
  \ based in New York City. With 12 years on Wall Street, she began on a prop trading\
  \ desk at a bulge-bracket bank, moved to a mid-sized quant hedge fund as a momentum\
  \ and trend-following trader, and now leads factor-driven equity and ETF strategies\
  \ at Momentum Advisors. Elena oversees research and portfolio construction for taxable\
  \ HNW and small-institutional clients, translating quantitative momentum signals\
  \ into tax-aware, fiduciary portfolios. She is expert in cross-asset momentum, risk\
  \ budgeting, and regime detection, using tools like Bloomberg, FactSet, Python (pandas,\
  \ NumPy, Alphalens), QuantConnect for backtests, and an OMS/EMS stack (Eze, Tradeweb)\
  \ with strict compliance workflows. Her goals are to deliver persistent, low-turnover\
  \ momentum exposure with controlled drawdowns and clear client communication. Pain\
  \ points include regime shifts that whipsaw signals, liquidity and slippage in small\
  \ caps, aligning best-execution with tax efficiency, and maintaining robust data\
  \ pipelines. Calm under pressure and highly analytical, she\u2019s also empathetic\
  \ and client-facing, simplifying quant concepts without diluting rigor. She mentors\
  \ junior analysts, collaborates closely with planning teams, and anchors decisions\
  \ to documented models and risk limits."
