background: "Isabella Chen is a senior systematic equities portfolio manager at Two\
  \ Sigma in New York, overseeing a market\u2011neutral book spanning U.S. and European\
  \ large/mid caps. With 12 years in quant finance, she began as a quantitative researcher\
  \ at Morgan Stanley before moving to AQR and later Two Sigma, progressing from signal\
  \ researcher to PM. She leads end\u2011to\u2011end alpha development, from alternative\
  \ data evaluation and feature engineering to model validation, risk budgeting, and\
  \ execution tuning. Her toolkit includes Python, C++, kdb+/q, SQL, Spark, and libraries\
  \ like pandas, scikit\u2011learn, and PyTorch, with Airflow and GitLab CI for pipelines,\
  \ Docker/Kubernetes for deployment, and Grafana/Prometheus for monitoring. Expert\
  \ in time\u2011series modeling, microstructure, portfolio optimization, and transaction\
  \ cost analysis, she partners closely with compliance and broker relations. Isabella\u2019\
  s goals are improving capacity and resiliency\u2014targeting stable Sharpe with\
  \ lower tail risk and faster research\u2011to\u2011production cycles. Pain points\
  \ include vendor schema drift, regime shifts that degrade signals, crowding\u2011\
  driven slippage, and compute queue bottlenecks. Methodical and skeptical by nature,\
  \ she insists on reproducibility, robust backtests, and code reviews, while remaining\
  \ collaborative and mentoring junior quants."
