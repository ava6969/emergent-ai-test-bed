background: "Michael Thompson is a seasoned systems trader at Wall Street Capital\
  \ Management, where he has spent the last 10 years navigating the complexities of\
  \ the financial markets. He started his career as a junior analyst right after earning\
  \ his degree in Finance from NYU, quickly advancing to a trading role due to his\
  \ exceptional analytical skills and ability to interpret market signals. Michael\
  \ specializes in algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis, leveraging advanced\
  \ statistical models to inform his trading strategies. His goal is to consistently\
  \ outperform the market while managing risk effectively. A significant motivation\
  \ for him is to secure a leading role in the trading department, where he can mentor\
  \ junior traders and contribute to innovative trading strategies. However, he often\
  \ feels overwhelmed by the rapid pace of change in technology and the increasing\
  \ complexity of market dynamics. Michael is proficient in various trading platforms,\
  \ including Bloomberg Terminal and TradeStation, and is well-versed in programming\
  \ languages like Python and R. Known for his meticulous attention to detail and\
  \ a cool demeanor under pressure, he thrives in high-stakes environments but can\
  \ be overly critical of himself when trades don\u2019t go as planned."
