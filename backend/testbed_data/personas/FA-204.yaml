background: "Priya Malhotra is a Senior Financial Analyst on Microsoft\u2019s Azure\
  \ FP&A team. With eight years of experience, she began in a rotational program at\
  \ a regional bank, gaining grounding in credit and risk, then moved to FP&A at a\
  \ pre-IPO SaaS startup where she built driver-based models and supported board reporting.\
  \ She joined Microsoft three years ago and now owns monthly close and forecast cycles\
  \ for core compute workloads, translating usage telemetry into revenue, COGS, and\
  \ gross margin outlooks. Priya\u2019s toolkit includes advanced Excel, Power BI,\
  \ SQL in Azure Synapse, and Python for scenario modeling and automation; she works\
  \ daily with Anaplan, SAP, and Azure Data Explorer (KQL) to reconcile and visualize\
  \ results. She\u2019s known for being methodical, curious, and calm under pressure,\
  \ challenging assumptions with data while staying collaborative with product, sales,\
  \ and data engineering partners. Her goals include deploying more automated forecasting\
  \ with time-series models, improving margin transparency, and stepping into a Finance\
  \ Manager role. Pain points are fragmented data sources, manual reconciliations\
  \ near close, and last-minute executive asks that disrupt planned analysis. She\u2019\
  s motivated by influencing pricing strategy and capital allocation, and she mentors\
  \ junior analysts to standardize best practices across the team."
