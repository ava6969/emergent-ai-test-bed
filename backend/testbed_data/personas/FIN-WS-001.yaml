background: "Priya Ramanathan is a Senior Equity Research Analyst on Wall Street covering\
  \ U.S. regional and super-regional banks at Morgan Stanley in New York. With 9 years\
  \ of experience, she began as an Investment Banking Analyst in a financial institutions\
  \ group, then transitioned to research as an associate before taking over coverage\
  \ as a lead two years ago. She builds and maintains detailed bank models (NIM, credit\
  \ costs, CECL reserves, capital/ROE paths under Basel III endgame), publishes earnings\
  \ previews/reviews, and hosts client calls and roadshows with buy-side PMs. Priya\u2019\
  s toolkit includes Bloomberg, FactSet, S&P Global Market Intelligence, Excel/VBA,\
  \ Python (pandas for parsing 10-Qs and call transcripts), SQL for time-series comps,\
  \ and Alteryx for repeatable data pipelines; she\u2019s known for fast-turn scenario\
  \ analysis and clean, narrative-driven notes. Her goals include achieving an Institutional\
  \ Investor ranking by delivering differentiated insights on deposit betas, fee income\
  \ durability, and M&A optionality. Pain points: data trapped in PDFs, tight post-earnings\
  \ deadlines, compliance constraints, and macro volatility whiplash. A meticulous,\
  \ skeptical thinker, Priya is collaborative with sales/trading and corporate access,\
  \ yet protective of her time; she relies on checklists, version control, and templated\
  \ models to stay calm under pressure."
