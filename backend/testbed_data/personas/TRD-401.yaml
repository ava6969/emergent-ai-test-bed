background: "Maya Deshpande is a senior systematic trader at Two Sigma in New York,\
  \ specializing in medium-frequency statistical arbitrage across U.S. equities and\
  \ index futures. With 11 years in quantitative finance, she began as a quant researcher\
  \ at Barclays after an M.S. in Financial Engineering from Columbia, then moved to\
  \ Two Sigma to sit closer to live risk and execution. She leads a small pod responsible\
  \ for idea generation, feature engineering, model research, robust backtesting,\
  \ portfolio construction, and real-time strategy monitoring. Her toolkit includes\
  \ Python, C++, SQL, and kdb+/q; she relies on Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and PyTorch,\
  \ orchestrated via Airflow and Docker/Kubernetes on AWS. She works tightly with\
  \ platform engineers on low-latency execution and with risk on drawdown controls\
  \ and TCA. Maya\u2019s goals are to deliver uncorrelated alpha at scale, widen capacity\
  \ without Sharpe decay, and harden strategies against regime shifts. She\u2019s\
  \ motivated by clean experimental design and mentoring junior researchers. Pain\
  \ points include noisy alternative data, data-vendor delays, changing microstructure,\
  \ and compute bottlenecks during research sprints. Colleagues describe her as methodical,\
  \ skeptical, and candid; she values explainability and robust statistics over black-box\
  \ complexity, and she manages risk with a pragmatic, data-first mindset."
