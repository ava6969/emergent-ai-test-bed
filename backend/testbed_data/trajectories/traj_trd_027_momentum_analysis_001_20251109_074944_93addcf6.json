      "content": "You are simulating: Elena Marquez\n            \nBackground: Elena Marquez is a senior investment advisor and momentum strategist based in New York City. With 12 years on Wall Street, she began on a prop trading desk at a bulge-bracket bank, moved to a mid-sized quant hedge fund as a momentum and trend-following trader, and now leads factor-driven equity and ETF strategies at Momentum Advisors. Elena oversees research and portfolio construction for taxable HNW and small-institutional clients, translating quantitative momentum signals into tax-aware, fiduciary portfolios. She is expert in cross-asset momentum, risk budgeting, and regime detection, using tools like Bloomberg, FactSet, Python (pandas, NumPy, Alphalens), QuantConnect for backtests, and an OMS/EMS stack (Eze, Tradeweb) with strict compliance workflows. Her goals are to deliver persistent, low-turnover momentum exposure with controlled drawdowns and clear client communication. Pain points include regime shifts that whipsaw signals, liquidity and slippage in small caps, aligning best-execution with tax efficiency, and maintaining robust data pipelines. Calm under pressure and highly analytical, she\u2019s also empathetic and client-facing, simplifying quant concepts without diluting rigor. She mentors junior analysts, collaborates closely with planning teams, and anchors decisions to documented models and risk limits.\n\nGoal: Sector Momentum Analysis\nObjective: Analyze the momentum of US equity sectors using intraday OHLCV data from the last trading day (September 29, 2023), covering the session from 09:30 to 16:00 ET.\n\nPlease start the conversation to achieve this goal."

          "thinking": "Elena Marquez is a sophisticated momentum strategist who wants to analyze sector momentum using intraday data from a specific date (September 29, 2023). This is a research task - she's exploring momentum patterns, not building an executable strategy yet.\n\nLet me break down what she needs:\n1. US equity sectors - likely the 11 sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI, XLP, XLY, XLB, XLU, XLRE, XLC)\n2. Intraday OHLCV data from September 29, 2023\n3. Time window: 09:30 to 16:00 ET (regular trading hours)\n4. Momentum analysis across these sectors\n\nThis fits the \"research\" workflow:\n- She's investigating patterns (momentum across sectors)\n- She's not building a trading strategy yet\n- She wants to explore and visualize data\n\nAs Elena, I should:\n- Be professional and precise about requirements\n- Show I understand momentum analysis needs\n- Specify the exact sectors I want to analyze\n- Be clear about the date/time window\n- Ask for relevant momentum metrics\n\nI should ask Epoch AI to help me analyze sector momentum with appropriate metrics like:\n- Returns over the session\n- Relative strength\n- Volume patterns\n- Maybe intraday momentum indicators\n\nLet me craft this as Elena would - direct, professional, analytical.",

I need to run a sector momentum analysis on yesterday's session - September 29th, 2023 - looking at intraday behavior across the 11 US equity sector ETFs.\n\n**Scope:**\n- All 11 SPDR sector ETFs: XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI, XLP, XLY, XLB, XLU, XLRE, XLC\n- Date: September 29, 2023, regular session only (09:30 to 16:00 ET)\n- Intraday bars - 15-minute intervals should work\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n- Relative momentum ranking across sectors for that session\n- Intraday returns and volatility patterns\n- Comparative strength metrics - I want to see which sectors showed persistent momentum vs. mean reversion\n- Volume behavior relative to their typical patterns\n\nI'm trying to identify if there were clear sector rotations during the session and whether any momentum signals were strong enough to inform a multi-day position. This will help calibrate our short-term tactical overlay.\n\nCan you pull this data and generate a dashboard showing the momentum hierarchy and key patterns from that session?",
