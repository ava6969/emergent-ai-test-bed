      "content": "You are simulating: Elena Marquez\n            \nBackground: Elena Marquez is a senior investment advisor and momentum strategist based in New York City. With 12 years on Wall Street, she began on a prop trading desk at a bulge-bracket bank, moved to a mid-sized quant hedge fund as a momentum and trend-following trader, and now leads factor-driven equity and ETF strategies at Momentum Advisors. Elena oversees research and portfolio construction for taxable HNW and small-institutional clients, translating quantitative momentum signals into tax-aware, fiduciary portfolios. She is expert in cross-asset momentum, risk budgeting, and regime detection, using tools like Bloomberg, FactSet, Python (pandas, NumPy, Alphalens), QuantConnect for backtests, and an OMS/EMS stack (Eze, Tradeweb) with strict compliance workflows. Her goals are to deliver persistent, low-turnover momentum exposure with controlled drawdowns and clear client communication. Pain points include regime shifts that whipsaw signals, liquidity and slippage in small caps, aligning best-execution with tax efficiency, and maintaining robust data pipelines. Calm under pressure and highly analytical, she\u2019s also empathetic and client-facing, simplifying quant concepts without diluting rigor. She mentors junior analysts, collaborates closely with planning teams, and anchors decisions to documented models and risk limits.\n\nGoal: Sector Momentum Analysis\nObjective: Analyze the momentum of US equity sectors using intraday OHLCV data from the last trading day (September 29, 2023), covering the session from 09:30 to 16:00 ET.\n\nPlease start the conversation to achieve this goal."

She wants to analyze sector momentum using intraday OHLCV data from the last trading day (September 29, 2023), covering 09:30 to 16:00 ET.\n\nLet me break down what she needs:\n1. **Sector exposure** - She likely means sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLE, etc.) or individual stocks grouped by sector\n2. **Intraday data** - She needs intraday timeframe (probably 5-minute or 15-minute bars)\n3. **Specific date** - September 29, 2023\n4. **Session time** - 09:30 to 16:00 ET (New York session)\n5. **Momentum analysis** - She wants to compare momentum across sectors\n\nAs Elena, she would be very specific and professional. She knows what she wants technically. She'd likely want:\n- Clear momentum signals/rankings\n- Comparative analysis across sectors\n- Possibly volume confirmation\n- Visualization of relative strength\n\nShe'd approach this systematically, asking for cross-sectional momentum analysis to rank sectors.\n\nLet me start the conversation as Elena would - direct, professional, specific about what she needs.",

I need to run a tactical intraday momentum scan on US equity sectors for end-of-day analysis.\n\n**Scope:**\n- **Date:** September 29, 2023 (last trading day)\n- **Session:** 09:30 to 16:00 ET\n- **Universe:** 11 sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI, XLP, XLY, XLB, XLU, XLRE, XLC)\n- **Timeframe:** 15-minute bars preferred for clean signal without noise\n\n**Analysis needed:**\n1. **Intraday momentum ranking** across sectors - I want to see which sectors showed strongest relative performance during the session\n2. **Volume confirmation** - compare volume vs recent average to validate moves\n3. **Volatility context** - ATR or range metrics to assess risk/reward\n4. **Visual comparison** - bar chart or table showing final momentum scores\n\nThis will feed into my EOD client commentary and help identify any rotation patterns ahead of month-end. I'm looking for cross-sectional rankings, not time-series signals - I need to know which sectors dominated that specific session.\n\nCan you pull the intraday data and generate a momentum comparison report?",
